Diesel Erotika FUD Crypter v1.0 - Educational Security Research Tool
Critical Notice: This tool is exclusively designed for ethical, legal, and educational security research in authorized environments. Any use for illegal activities, malicious purposes, or unauthorized access is strictly prohibited and violates GitHub's Community Guidelines. Users are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws.
Purpose
Diesel Erotika FUD Crypter is a VB.NET-based tool developed for security researchers, students, and developers to study software protection techniques, obfuscation methods, and anti-detection mechanisms in controlled, authorized test environments. As a Fully Undetectable (FUD) Crypter, it is intended for educational purposes to explore reverse engineering and software security concepts.
Features
All features are implemented in VB.NET and are designed for use in secure, isolated research environments:

.NET and Native File Support: Processes .NET and native files for analysis.
Virtual Machine Detection: Simulates detection of VMware Workstation for research purposes.
Sandbox Detection: Simulates identification of SandBoxie environments for testing.
Windows Defender Simulation: Models disabling Windows Defender in virtualized test setups.
Task Manager Simulation: Simulates restricting Task Manager for controlled experiments.
File Concealment: Hides files during research to study stealth techniques.
Task Termination: Simulates process termination in test environments.
Process Injection Simulation: Models injection into processes (e.g., RegAsm, explorer, svchost) for analysis.
Execution Delay: Adds configurable delays for timing studies.
Startup Options: Supports standard or hidden startup for research scenarios.
Assembly Modification: Alters assembly metadata for educational purposes.
Digital Signature Simulation: Mimics digital signatures in controlled settings.
File Download Simulation: Tests downloading of authorized files.
Code Obfuscation: Applies obfuscation techniques for studying code protection.
Random Code Generation: Generates randomized code to analyze evasion techniques.
String Customization: Allows adjustable string lengths and multilingual naming (English, Chinese, Arabic).
Garbage Code Optimization: Reduces unnecessary code for research efficiency.

Code Overview
The tool is written in VB.NET to leverage its robust framework for educational tools. Below is a simplified VB.NET code snippet demonstrating a basic obfuscation function for illustrative purposes:
namespace %ModuleName%
{

    public partial class MainForm : Form
    {

        public MainForm()
        {



        }



        private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {

            bool IsOpen = false;

            FormCollection fc = Application.OpenForms;

            foreach (Form f in fc)
            {

                if (f.Name == "Form1")
                {

                    IsOpen = true;

                    f.Focus();

                    break;

                }

            }



            if (IsOpen == false)
            {



            }

        }



    }

}

    Sub ObfuscateFile(inputPath As String, outputPath As String)
        ' Simulate basic obfuscation for educational purposes
        Dim fileBytes As Byte() = File.ReadAllBytes(inputPath)
        Dim modifiedBytes As Byte() = RandomizeBytes(fileBytes)
        File.WriteAllBytes(outputPath, modifiedBytes)
    End Sub

    Function RandomizeBytes(bytes As Byte()) As Byte()
        ' Simulate byte randomization for research
        Dim rand As New Random()
        For i As Integer = 0 To bytes.Length - 1
            bytes(i) = bytes(i) Xor CByte(rand.Next(0, 255))
        Next
        Return bytes
    End Function
End Module

Note: This is a simplified example. The full implementation includes advanced features for educational research, strictly adhering to ethical guidelines.
