Diesel Erotika FUD Crypter v1.0 - Ethical Security Research Tool
Important Disclaimer: This tool is a Fully Undetectable (FUD) Crypter designed solely for legal and ethical security research purposes. Any illegal activities or misuse are strictly prohibited. Users must only use this software within their authorized scope and in compliance with applicable laws.
Overview
Diesel Erotika FUD Crypter is a specialized tool developed in VB.NET for security professionals and developers to conduct research on software protection, obfuscation, and anti-detection techniques. As a Fully Undetectable (FUD) Crypter, it aims to bypass detection mechanisms in controlled environments for educational purposes in software security and reverse engineering.
Features
The following features are implemented in VB.NET to support advanced security research:

.NET and Native File Support: Processes both .NET and native executable files.
Anti-VMware Workstation: Detects VMware Workstation environments (for research purposes only).
Anti-SandBoxie: Identifies SandBoxie instances (for controlled testing).
Disable Windows Defender Simulation: Simulates disabling Windows Defender in test environments.
Disable Task Manager Simulation: Simulates restricting Task Manager access for research.
File Hiding: Conceals files during execution for analysis.
Task Kill: Terminates specified processes in controlled settings.
Process Injection: Simulates injection into processes like RegAsm, explorer, and svchost.
Delay Addition: Introduces configurable delays for execution timing.
Hidden and Normal Startup: Supports stealth or standard startup methods.
Assembly Changer: Modifies assembly information for research purposes.
Digital Signature Simulation: Mimics digital signatures for testing.
File Downloader: Downloads files (for legal files only) in research scenarios.
Obfuscator: Applies code obfuscation to protect or analyze software.
Random Code Generation: Generates randomized code to evade static analysis.
Adjustable String Lengths: Allows customization of string lengths for obfuscation.
Multilingual String Renaming: Supports renaming in English, Chinese, and Arabic.
Automatic Garbage Code Reduction: Reduces unnecessary code with detection mechanisms.

Code Overview
The project is written entirely in VB.NET to leverage its robust framework for building secure and efficient tools. Below is a simplified code snippet demonstrating the core structure of the crypter (for illustrative purposes):
Imports System
Imports System.IO
Imports System.Diagnostics

Module Program
    Sub Main()
        Try
            ' Example: File obfuscation and process injection simulation
            Dim inputFile As String = "sample.exe"
            Dim outputFile As String = "obfuscated_sample.exe"
            ObfuscateFile(inputFile, outputFile)
            SimulateProcessInjection("svchost.exe")
            AddExecutionDelay(500)
            Console.WriteLine("FUD Crypter executed successfully.")
        Catch ex As Exception
            Console.WriteLine("Error: " & ex.Message)
        End Try
    End Sub

    Sub ObfuscateFile(inputPath As String, outputPath As String)
        ' Simulate file obfuscation
        Dim fileBytes As Byte() = File.ReadAllBytes(inputPath)
        ' Apply randomization and encryption (simplified)
        File.WriteAllBytes(outputPath, RandomizeBytes(fileBytes))
    End Sub

    Function RandomizeBytes(bytes As Byte()) As Byte()
        ' Simulate randomization for FUD purposes
        Dim rand As New Random()
        For i As Integer = 0 To bytes.Length - 1
            bytes(i) = bytes(i) Xor CByte(rand.Next(0, 255))
        Next
        Return bytes
    End Function

    Sub SimulateProcessInjection(processName As String)
        ' Simulate process injection for research
        Console.WriteLine("Simulating injection into: " & processName)
    End Sub

    Sub AddExecutionDelay(milliseconds As Integer)
        ' Simulate delay for execution timing
        Threading.Thread.Sleep(milliseconds)
    End Sub
End Module

Note: The above code is a simplified example for demonstration. The full implementation includes advanced obfuscation, anti-detection, and multilingual support as listed in the features.
