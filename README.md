' Diesel Erotika FUD Crypter v1.0 - Educational Security Research Tool
'
' Critical Notice: This tool is exclusively designed for ethical, legal, and educational
' security research in authorized environments. Any use for illegal activities, malicious
' purposes, or unauthorized access is strictly prohibited and violates GitHub's Community
' Guidelines. Users are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws.
'
' Purpose:
' Diesel Erotika FUD Crypter is a VB.NET-based tool developed for security researchers,
' students, and developers to study software protection techniques, obfuscation methods,
' and anti-detection mechanisms in controlled, authorized test environments. As a Fully
' Undetectable (FUD) Crypter, it is intended for educational purposes to explore reverse
' engineering and software security concepts.
'
' Features:
' - .NET and Native File Support: Processes .NET and native files for analysis.
' - Virtual Machine Detection: Simulates detection of VMware Workstation for research.
' - Sandbox Detection: Simulates identification of SandBoxie environments for testing.
' - Windows Defender Simulation: Models disabling Windows Defender in virtualized test setups.
' - Task Manager Simulation: Simulates restricting Task Manager for controlled experiments.
' - File Concealment: Hides files during research to study stealth techniques.
' - Task Termination: Simulates process termination in test environments.
' - Process Injection Simulation: Models injection into processes (e.g., RegAsm, explorer, svchost).
' - Execution Delay: Adds configurable delays for timing studies.
' - Startup Options: Supports standard or hidden startup for research scenarios.
' - Assembly Modification: Alters assembly metadata for educational purposes.
' - Digital Signature Simulation: Mimics digital signatures in controlled settings.
' - File Download Simulation: Tests downloading of authorized files.
' - Code Obfuscation: Applies obfuscation techniques for studying code protection.
' - Random Code Generation: Generates randomized code to analyze evasion techniques.
' - String Customization: Allows adjustable string lengths and multilingual naming (English, Chinese, Arabic).
' - Garbage Code Optimization: Reduces unnecessary code for research efficiency.
'
' Installation:
' 1. Clone the repository:
'    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diesel-erotika-fud-crypter.git
' 2. Install .NET Framework 4.8 or higher.
' 3. Open the project in a VB.NET-compatible IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).
' 4. Build the solution in a secure, isolated environment (e.g., a virtual machine).
'
' Requirements:
' - VB.NET development environment
' - .NET Framework 4.8+
' - Windows OS (use in a virtualized test environment)
'
' Important: This tool must only be installed and executed in authorized, controlled environments.
'
' Usage:
' 1. Run the tool in a secure, isolated test environment (e.g., a virtual machine).
' 2. Configure settings for research (e.g., obfuscation level, string customization).
' 3. Use the tool to study software protection techniques in compliance with legal and ethical standards.
'
' Example Command (simulated CLI for VB.NET executable):
'    DieselErotikaCrypter.exe --input test.exe --output obfuscated.exe --obfuscate --lang English
'
' Warning: Unauthorized use or deployment on systems without explicit permission is prohibited.
'
' Usage Terms:
' - This tool is restricted to authorized test environments for legal and ethical security research.
' - Any use for malicious purposes, unauthorized access, or illegal activities violates GitHub’s Terms of Service.
' - Users must comply with all local, national, and international laws.
