#Diesel Erotica FUD Crypter v1.0  
### üß™ Ethical Security Research Tool ‚Äî VB.NET Based

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

**Diesel Erotika FUD Crypter** is intended**solely for ethical, legal, and educational security research**. This tool must **only be used in controlled, authorized environments** such as virtual machines or sandboxes.

Any use for **malicious activity**, **unauthorized access**, or**real-world evasion** is strictly prohibited and violates [GitHub's Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service ) and applicable law.

## üß© Overview

Diesel Erotica is a research-grade **Fully Undetectable (FUD) Crypter**built in **VB.NET **. It enables security researchers and developers to explore:

- Software obfuscation
- Reverse engineering
- Malware analysis resistance
- Anti-detection simulations

This project is **educational in nature** and supports advanced software protection experiment in**isolated virtual environments**.

## ‚ú® Features

| Category | Description |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| File Compatibility | Supports both `.NET' and native executable files |
| Anti-Analysis | Simulated detection of **VMware Workstation** and **Sandboxie** |
| Defender Simulation | Simulations disabled **Windows Defender** (in test mode only) |
| Task Manager Restrict / Simulations **blocking Task Manager** in controlled experiments |
| File Hiding / Temporarily hides files for stealth analysis |
| Process Termination / Simulations task kills in test environments |
|Process Injection/Demonstrations injection into `svchost`, `explorer`, `RegAsm`, etc.           |
| Delays | Adds configurable execution delays |
| Startup Modes | Supports **hidden** or**standard** startup configurations |
|Assembly Modifier/Randomizes metadata (name, version, GUID, etc.)                             |
/ Digital Signature Mock / Simulations of signing (non-functional, for educational study) |
| File Downloader / Simulations downloading of safe, allowed files |
/ Obfuscation Engine / Obfuscates code to bypass basic static analysis |
| Code Randomizer / Injections random garbage code for analysis |
| String Customization | Adjustable string length and multilingual support (EN, CN, Dec) |
| Code Cleanup | Automatically removes unwanted junk code |

## üíª Code Example (Simplified)

`'vbnet
Import System
Imports System.IO
The Import System.Diagnostics

Module Program
    Sub Main()
        Try
            Dim Input File As String = "sample.exe"
            Dim Output File As String = "obfuscated_sample.exe"
            ObfuscateFile(Input File, Output file)
            SimulateProcessInjection("svchost.exe")
            AddExecutionDelay(500)
            Console.WriteLine("FUD Crypter executed successfully (educational use only).")
        Catch ex As Exception
            Console.WriteLine("Error: " & ex.Message)
        End Try
    End Sub

    Sub ObfuscateFile(Input Path As String, Output Path As String)
        Dim fileBytes As Byte() = File.ReadAllBytes(InputPath)
        String bag.WriteAllBytes(OutputPath, RandomizeBytes(fileBytes))
    End Sub

    Function RandomizeBytes(bytes As Byte()) As Byte()
        Dim rand As New Random()
        For i As Integer = 0 To bytes.Length - 1
            bytes(i) = bytes(i) Xor CByte(rand.Next(0, 255))
        Next
        Return bytes
    End Function

    Sub SimulateProcessInjection(ProcessName As String)
        Console.WriteLine("Simulating injection into:" & ProcessName)
    End Sub

    Sub AddExecutionDelay(milliseconds As Integer)
        Threading.Thread.Sleep(milliseconds)
    End Sub
End Module
